      <span class="title title-about">The long version:</span> I grew up in
      Santa Barbara, CA, but since 2005 I've called the Pacific Northwest home.
      After spending over 10 years in Washington State I moved to PDX in 2016.
      I hope I never have to leave.

      In college I studied Mandarin Chinese and spent a total of nine months
      living in Taichung, Taiwan, and Beijing and Fuzhou, China. I’m rusty now,
      but at the time I was pretty good – apparently my tonal pronunciation
      was quite accurate. Besides acquiring the ability to speak a new language,
      studying Chinese also taught me a lot of important lessons about how to
      be a better learner, including:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-about">
      <li>something that initially feels uncomfortable can became second nature with enough practice</li>
      <li>grounding in solid patterns of speech (or code!) can get you through most situations</li>
      <li>don't let self-consciousness be a barrier to trying something new – from vulnerability comes growth</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="copy copy-about">
      Oh, and I once spent the night in a guardtower on the Great Wall of China. So that was pretty cool.

      Professionally, my career to date has been quite diverse. I started off as
      a commercial real estate photographer at an <a href="https://www.yardi.com">
      enterprise software company</a>; then I did a complete 180 and taught 9th
      grade World History at a small, outdoor education-focused
      <a href="http://www.sbms.org">middle school</a>. Teaching wasn’t the perfect
      fit but I knew I still wanted to be in education, so I spent the next several
      years doing finance and operations at a variety of education-focused nonprofits.
      My experience in this field culminated in my role as a program analyst
      with <a href="http://www.highlineschools.org/"> Highline Public Schools</a>,
      where I maintained a budget database that covered over $30 million annually
      in state, federal and private funding for high-need schools and students.
    </p>
    <p class="copy copy-about">
      Throughout this stage of my career, one theme became increasingly clear:
      I loved creating and maintaining systems to make my organization deliver
      its service more efficiently and effectively, but the tools we used were
      often not up to the task. I searched for a mental framework that would
      help me analyze challenges and propose solutions that benefitted the user,
      and I found it in User Experience. Studying UX at the <a href="http://svcseattle.com">
      School of Visual Concepts</a> in Seattle, attending Design Thinking workshops
      through work, and testing out UX principles on projects at work was incredibly
      exciting: finally I had a vocabulary for constructively critiquing and
      prototyping improvements to workflows, business tools and their resulting
      effects on the user. But one piece was still missing: I lacked the skills
      to personally create a better type of tool or process.
    </p>
    <p class="copy copy-about">
      So, I left my job and embarked on the path upon which I now walk: becoming
      a developer. To acquire modern web development skills I joined Code Builders,
      a six month intensive web development bootcamp based in Seattle. You can
      read more about Code Builders on my <a href="/portfolio">portfolio page</a>.
      After wrapping up Code Builders I moved down to Portland where I’ve interned
      at an ad agency and worked on projects to sharpen my skills. My mission is still
      to help make effective, beautiful user-facing tools that measurably help users
      tackle practical challenges in their daily lives. If you’ve read this far,
      then I suspect you may share this goal – if so,

      working together!

      and working on my midcentury home.
