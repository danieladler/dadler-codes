title: Code Builders
blurb-short: Six-month intensive web development bootcamp and apprenticeship, turning students from internet users to internet creators.
blurb-long: I've long had a passion for design and technology, and Code Builders gave me the tools to bring ideas to life on the web. With a 6:1 student-to-teacher ratio, we received highly focused and deeply personalized instruction. The six-month, full-time curriculum focused on the Ruby on Rails stack&#58; Ruby, Rails, PostgreSQL, HTML5/CSS3 (SASS, Bourbon, Bootstrap), JavaScript (vanilla, jQuery &amp; React), Agile development (TDD with RSpec) and Agile workflows (daily standup, pairing, PRs and code review), and tools (Github, PivotalTracker, Slack &amp; Trello). <br /><br  />Over six months we built projects of increasing techincal complexity. My favorite group project was <a href="https://petpointer.herokuapp.com/">PetPointer</a>, a 'WalkScore for Pets' API that leverages the Yelp, Zillow and Google Maps APIs to calculate the pet-friendliness of an address based on that location's proximity to parks, Yelp rating quality of vets and pet stores & services, interior and exterior square footage, and noise pollution. My favorite individual project was <a href="http://image-rater-dadler.herokuapp.com/"> Photosquid</a>, an image-sharing and -rating platform featuring image uploading with CarrierWave, image storage with AWS/S3, and user notification emails with Rails mailers.
