title: Code Builders Dev Shop
blurb-short: From bootcamp student to dev shop apprentice&#58; a culminating experience working on client contracts.
blurb-long: After six months of intensive web development study, Code Builders students became C.B. dev shop apprecentices working on client contracts and internal-facing projects. My work for CB included writing unit and functional tests for the <a href="http://youthappschallenge.org/">reviewer portal</a> of a youth <a href="http://www.technology-alliance.com/youth-apps/">app design competition</a>, improving UI for wholesale customers of a <a href="http://lightintheattic.net/">record label</a>, and building an all-React frontend prototype of a Code Builders internal app.
