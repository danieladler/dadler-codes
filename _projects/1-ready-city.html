title: Ready City
blurb-short: Natural disaster preparation made easy&#58; customized, actionable preparations unique to each user's life situation.
blurb-long: Ready City simplifies the daunting task of preparing for natural disasters. Instead of poring through long PDFs and hard-to-navigate government websites with one-size-fits-all instructions, users deserve a streamlined and actionable list of preparations unique to their life situation.<br /><br /> Ready City delivers on this concept by asking users to fill out a simple assessment of their home, dependents, contacts, and where they spend the most time. This input generates a personalized list of preparations sortable by priority level and category. In future iterations, users will be able to practice natural disaster simulations, share preparation plans and budget how much money and time will be needed to create a complete preparedness plan.
