title: Eugene Weston III
blurb-short: Paying homage to my grandfather (and giving myself a front end playground) by turning a 1950's pamphlet into a 2017 responsive webpage.
blurb-long: See that <strong>{Weston}</strong> up at the top of your screen? It comes from Eugene Weston III, my maternal grandfather. He was a third-generation architect who designed some really beautiful midcentury homes, and his aesthetic has heavily influenced my tastes. So when I discovered a yellowing tri-fold pamphlet from the mid-50's describing his services, a lightbulb went off&#58; what if it was recreated word for word, film grain by film grain, but as a responsive web page? ew-iii is the result. Now I aspire for this to be an ongoing project where I continue to apply bits of front end knowledge as I learn new techniques. <br><br> <strong> NB&#58 </strong> I'm pretty sure the photographs were taken by Julius Shulman, so all credit for these beautiful images goes to him and his estate.
