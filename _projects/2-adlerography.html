title: Adlerography
blurb-short: Travel and wedding photography displayed on an artisinally crafted Express app.
blurb-long: At the age of 15 I discovered photography, and a creative spark was lit. In my teens and twenties I carried my camera everywhere (especially overseas), and recently I've started taking photos of weddings. Adlerography is a collection of my favorite images throughout the years. Travel-related sections are displayed as a slideshow overlay within the site; wedding sections link out to unique single-page sites custom-created for each happy couple.
